# Sheet-Music-Reader-App
This is an app that is designed to read music sheets and digitize it. Future features will include a metronome and a tuner.

The MusicBuddy User Manual

The MusicBuddy app helps music instrument learners through a variety of useful features. The app includes a music digitizer to play back sheet music, a metronome as well as a tuner that responds to the sound played from an instrument.

Using the Menu

At the bottom of the screen, there are tabs for the other features available on the app.
	Music Digitizer
	Metronome
	Tuner
The floating tabs should always exist within the app and clicking on one of these tabs will switch screens.

How to Use the Music Digitizer

Permissions required: Camera (Optional), Storage

The Music Digitizer allows users to take pictures of their sheet music. The app will analyze it and identify the notes of the sheet music. Users can then playback these notes and adjust the notes and key signatures as required.

For optimum conditions, the app requires well-lit images in which there is a clear difference between black notes and the white page. Shadows may throw off the image processing.
	
Current limitations:
•	The app cannot recognize rhythm (dotted, eight, sixteenth notes etc.). All these notes will be considered as one beat
•	The app may struggle to interpret half notes (due to the hole in the bead of the note)
•	The app cannot recognize individual bars
•	The app cannot recognize music notation (eg. forte, coda, piano)
•	The app does not understand key signatures. Key signatures can be updated later within the app.

Much of the sheet music-reader code was modified from Katrina Lee's Sheet Music Reader Project at https://github.com/klee97/Sheet-Music-Reader.
